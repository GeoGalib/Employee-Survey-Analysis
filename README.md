Employee Survey Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes employee survey data to uncover the key factors influencing job satisfaction within an organization. The analysis examines a range of factors such as marital status, overtime, gender, age, department, and training hours to provide actionable insights into employee well-being.

Key Insights: 

Marital Status: Married employees report the lowest job satisfaction, which is concerning since they make up a significant portion of the workforce.

Overtime: Employees who work overtime show lower levels of satisfaction, a common issue across industries.

Gender: Males are less satisfied with their jobs compared to females and other genders.

Widowed Employees: The two widowed employees, both senior citizens, report being highly satisfied with their current positions.

Age: Employees aged between 40-50 are the happiest in their current roles.

Departments: IT, Customer Service, and Marketing departments show the lowest levels of satisfaction, highlighting areas for improvement.

Training Hours: Job satisfaction peaks with up to 60 hours of training per year. Additional training beyond this threshold appears to negatively impact satisfaction.

Conclusion

This analysis identifies the categories of employees who are least satisfied with their jobs but does not explore the specific reasons behind this dissatisfaction. Further research is recommended to identify the root causes and suggest targeted interventions.
